    "ESA's [Kelvins](https://kelvins.esa.int) competition \"[the OPS-SAT case](https://kelvins.esa.int/opssat/home/)\" is a novel data-centric challenge that asks you to work with the raw data of a satellite and very few provided labels to find the best parameters for a given machine learning model. Compared to previous competitions on Kelvins (like the [Pose Estimation](https://kelvins.esa.int/pose-estimation-2021/) or the [Proba-V Super-resolution challenge](https://kelvins.esa.int/proba-v-super-resolution/)) where the test-set is provided and the infered results are submitted, for the OPS-SAT case, we will run inference on the Kelvins server directly! To help you understand what is happening with your submission, this notebook replicates all steps that are executed by the script on our server, including computation of the scoring metric. We hope that it will be useful to you to avoid/find any bugs and prepare the best submission you can!"
